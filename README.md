# Warrior's Glory

------

## What is this project about? 

Warrior's Glory is a basic game that helped me learn the very basics of Python. This game is inspired by [Tech with Tim's tutorial](https://youtu.be/BO6LjtEOGZw?si=Bhzrdao1Ho3e-QJ1).

This game will have you depart from Clover Kingdom at the request of King William VII with a group of 10 knights in order to retrieve a rare emerald from the Land of Despair. Players will have to choose between 2/3 options when prompted. Each path has its own benefits and consequences, so players must be careful with how they proceed. 

In this game, I learned the syntax for the following:
- Data types
- Input statements 
- Declaring variables
- Printing to the terminal
- If/else statements
